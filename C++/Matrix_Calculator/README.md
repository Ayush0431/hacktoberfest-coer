Matrix calculations are usually tougher than linear calculations and usually take longer time in result computation; at the same time matrix calculations are useful and help in a number of situations, where linear computation is almost impossible.
Besides Matrices help vectorize code thereby reducing the number of loops and making our code faster. Therefore for these operations, matrix calculator comes in hamdy.

This Matrix Caluculator helps the user to perform operations like multiplication, addition , subtractiona and finding inverse of any matrix.
